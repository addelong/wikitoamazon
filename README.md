# wikitoamazon
A really simple browser extension that puts an Amazon link on Wikipedia pages for books with an ISBN.

This works in both Firefox and Chrome. Add it to Chrome by turning on Developer mode in your Extensions page. Add it to Firefox by going to about:debugging and load it as a temporary add-on.
